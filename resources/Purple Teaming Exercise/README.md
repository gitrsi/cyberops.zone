# Notes

## CTI

CTI Blueprint based on Behavior seen in relevant Campaigns by relevant Adversaries

## Defensive Scope

Purpose -> Objectives -> Scope

Example Criteria:
- Functionality: Detection/Mitigation/Investigation/Response
- Platforms
- Implementations


## Prioritization

Example Criteria:
- Risk = Likelyhood x Impact
- Technology Stack
- Current defensive Gaps
- Datasources
- Complexity
- Variance

## Extract TTPs
- Procedure Level
- Creatie an Adversary Profile
- Capability Abstraction Template can be used
- Create a high Level Adversary Emulation Plan

## Table Top
- Review high Level Plan
- Choose the TTPs to emulate
- Visibility/Expectations matrix
- Red Team creates an Adversary Emulation Plan afterwards

## Exercise
- Kick Off
- Preflight Checks
- Execution
- Tracking

## Results
- Benign vs. malicous
- Refine Hypothesis
- Confidence
