# Adversary Profile

## Description

Black Basta is considered a ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS) variant and was first identified in April
2022. Black Basta affiliates have impacted a wide range of businesses and critical infrastructure in
North America, Europe, and Australia. As of May 2024, Black Basta affiliates have impacted over 500
organizations globally.

Black Basta affiliates use common initial access techniques—such as phishing and exploiting known
vulnerabilities—and then employ a double-extortion model, both encrypting systems and exfiltrating
data

## Objective

As most campaigns are financially motivated, victims are usually given between 10 and 12 days to pay the ransom before the ransomware group publishes their data on the Black Basta TOR site, Basta News.
