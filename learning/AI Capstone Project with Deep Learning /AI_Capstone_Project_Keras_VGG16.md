> :bulb: Notes on "AI Capstone Project with Deep Learning"


# Instructions


## Grading criteria
Remember that this Module's work is worth 60 points. Your submitted work will be graded based on the following breakdown:
- Code for building a classifier using the VGG16 model (40 points)
- Code for testing both classifiers on a test set (10 points)
- Code for using both models for generating predictions on the test set images (10 points)


## Assignment Topic

In this assignment, you will be build an image classifier using pre-trained models, namely ResNet50 and VGG16. You will evaluate them as part of the training process, and then you will test them on a dedicated test set.

Guidelines and Instructions for the Assignment:

I have prepared a Jupyter Notebook that should guide you through the entire process of building your classifiers using the pre-trained models. Please download it here

You are essentially required to:
- Build your code to design a classifier using VGG16 pre-trained model. 
- Test both models, the one built using ResNet50 and VGG16, on a dedicated test set, which is provided to you in the Notebook.
- Report performance of both models on the test set and generate some predictions as detailed in the Notebook.
