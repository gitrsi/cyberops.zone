# Overview of Tensors
- In Pytorch, neural networks are composed of Pytorch tensors
- A Pytorch tensor is a data structure that is a generalization for numbers and dimensional arrays in Python
- For processing the neural network will apply a series of tensor operations on the input it receives
- easily convertable to numpy arrays and vice versa
- easy to integrate with "GPU"

Convert data to tensors
- each row in the db is a tensor
- tensor is a vector
- input the tensor into the neural network

Convert images to tensors
- usually represented as 2D/3D arrays
- each tensor is a matrix
