# Certificate of Competence in Zero Trust (CCZT)

## Zero Trust Fundamentals

Zero Trust is
- security model, strategy and framework
    - Never trust, always verify
    - Assume breach
    - Verify explicitly
    - Least privileged access

Assumptions
- Network is assumed to be hostile
- External and internal threats are always present
- Network locality isn't sufficient for determining trust
- Every single device, user and network flow is authenticated and authorized with dynymic policies


Never trust, always verify
- Trust isn't implicit
- Trust is a vulnerability
- every device, user, request is treated as potential threat
- just-in-time and just-enough-access least privilege access controls


Zero trust architecture (ZTA)
- cybersecurity plan to utilize zero trust concepts
- encompasses component relationships, workflow planning and access policies

$$
Zero Trust Enterprise = Zero Trust (ZT) + Zero trust architecture (ZTA)
